Posts go in the `_posts` folder and need to be named `YYYY-MM-DD-<whatever>.(html|md)`

The files need to have a FrontMatter section setting the title and author of the post (and maybe other stuff as well, later on).
E.g.

```
---
title: The title of the post
author: Your Name
---
```

Adding `<!--more-->` into the text will treat the preceding text as the excerpt to be used on the overview page.

Please use h4 (`####` in markdown) by default for section headers.
