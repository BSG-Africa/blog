Niel is a developer who is passionate about quality code and elegant solutions.
He always prefers to test drive his code and design, and he strongly believes
the technical practices of Extreme Programming are at the heart of successful
agile development. He loves a job done right and well, and enjoys getting out
and meeting people. Clients, stakeholders, colleagues and strangers.

He has spent most of the past five years doing Java development, primarily
using Spring, Hibernate, various testing frameworks, and a legion of other
libraries to develop web applications and mission critical back-end systems.
