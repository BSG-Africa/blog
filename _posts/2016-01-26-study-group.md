title: Software study group

We recently  started a little study group at a client. The group consisted of 7 developers of different levels from junior to senior developers. The study group undertook to study the book [Java 8 lambdas](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do) by Richard Warburton. The study group met weekly for an hour. 

In this blog I will share reasons for the formation of the study group, how the study group was conducted and interesting findings from the study group. <!--more-->

####Reasons for the study group

Firstly let us look at the WHY behind the formation of the study group. 

#####Increase learning from others

The study group presents the ideal opportunity for learning from others. At BSG we have inculcated the 70-20-10 model of learning, with 70% of knowledge coming from practical learning 'learning on the job', 20% from learning from others and the remaining 10% via formal training programs. The setup of our team in client environment is such that our developers from BSG are spread across different  cross-functional teams working on different projects at the same client. One of the aims of the study group is to increase cover of the 20% in the 70-20-10 model. In particular it may be tough for junior developers to learn directly from the clients senior developers and hence the study group presents a less intimidating environment to learn from fellow BSG colleagues who understand this learning model and are encouraged to share with the team

#####Learn New Tech

The client environment at present is restricted to Java 7 and the book that we decided to undertake learning was Java 8. This was done to show our proactive intent with regards to remaining in touch with current technology. 

#####Platform to practice

The study group presents an ideal platform for developers to practice presentation skills as well as code demonstrations. These  sessions have a small audience of 6 or 7 developers and hence the platform is an ideal launchpad before going to present at a user group or a conference.

#####Creating a sense of team 

The study group also gives the team a sense of belonging towards BSG and developers are encouraged to work beyond the client projects. 

####Study group format

The format of working through the book was ad-hoc and various methods of learning presented in this section were experimented with. 

#####Presentation

On the first week it was allocated to one developer to read the first chapter and create a presentation on the key readings. This was done well with code-snippets and diagrams highlighting the key leanings. However the presentation was done quickly which led to quite a bit of spare time and some people were not completely engaged in the presentation. This then led to the next method of presentation  

#####Code Demonstrations

It was then decided to go through some of the code snippets in the IDE. This spawned of much more interest with getting the team communicating more freely and making suggestions on how to improve the code, how to improve the method of coding as well as suggesting small pivoting experiments that helped people understand how it all works. 

#####Exercises 

The book also contained exercises which has a good unit test project that is available via GitHub. The group attempted these exercises within a session by breaking away into smaller teams of 2 developers each. The teams compared answers after completing each question and it was interesting to see that the teams achieved the correct outcomes using totally different approaches. This also provided an ideal opportunity for pair programming. 

#####Mob Programming

On one given day only one laptop was brought to the session and hence the exercises and code snippets from the the chapter of study were done by all the developers. One interesting finding of this session was that there was no allocated speaker to do the pre-work and hence the learning  was done on the fly by paging  through the pdf, team members interpreting the code and then experimentation in the IDE. This session had minimal to no preparation from any team member and yet members of the team were most engaged. 
 

####Benefits of the study group

Some of the benefits of hosting such a study group include

#####Communication

There was communication among team members

#####Understanding other technologies

In the case with Java 8 Lambdas various parallels were drawn with using C# .net lambda expressions

#####Shortcuts

All the developers picked up new key board shortcuts from  each other

#####Team

It was seen that the team worked better together with both junior and senior developers working well with each other.
