title: FNB CodeFest 2016 and Ionic 2 vs Xamarin

From 3 to 7 October I was fortunate enough to participate in the FNB CodeFest as part of the team from the [Foundery](http://foundery.co.za/). During this week-long hackathon, which included a 48-hour sprint, our team prototyped a virtual assistant using [Luis AI](https://www.luis.ai/), for natural language processing on two different mobile applications. CodeFest was a fantastic event - well organised and lots of fun. I hope to be back next year. <!--more-->

With the long-awaited release of Angular 2 last month, and Ionic 2 having reached Release Candidate 0, we decided to implement the same mobile application in both Ionic 2 and in Xamarin. 

The Xamarin team took an early lead, while the Ionic 2 team took their time getting to know the tools and frameworks. Despite Xamarin being relatively easy to get started with (especially if you're familiar with C#), the Ionic 2 team quickly caught up. In general, they had fewer lines of code to write (thanks Angular 2) and creating great looking components was a breeze. The Xamarin team, on the other hand, spent a lot of time fighting with a user interface, which they struggled to bend to their will, and when things went wrong they found the support available from the developer community was not what they had hoped for. We especially enjoyed the tools around Ionic, like it's great CLI, and the library of components.

On completion, we concluded that Ionic 2 was our hybrid mobile tool of choice, and - back at our day jobs - we have implemented Ionic 2 to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) for our current project.
